# CardStack App

## Overview

This is my first personal project, a web application for managing contacts or tasks with a unique, stackable card interface. Users can create new cards, assign them a priority, and then navigate through the stack using "up" and "down" buttons. The application features a clean, glassmorphism-inspired UI and smooth animations.

The app's functionality is a showcase of my understanding of web interactivity. All data is saved directly in the browser's LocalStorage, so it persists even after closing the tab.
